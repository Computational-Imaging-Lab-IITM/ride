# Recurrent Image Density Estimator

Code for training and evaluating the recurrent image density estimator (RIDE).

## Requirements

* Python >= 2.7.0
* NumPy >= 1.6.1
* [nlpcaffe](https://github.com/lucastheis/nlpcaffe)
* [cmt](https://github.com/lucastheis/cmt) >= 0.5.0

Note that this code requires [Russell Stewart's version of caffe](https://github.com/Russell91/nlpcaffe)
and that the default version of caffe is likely not going to work.
